## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow


### Continued development

While working on this project, I was reminded of how little javascript I know, I also encountered alot of issues while working on the css due to been away for a while. I would work on improving my knowledge on concepts; css-position, css-transition and animation, semantic css, javascript functions and the likes.

### Useful resources

- [8hour Basic JavaScript Course](https://youtu.be/EfAI9bwzVZk?si=36A6_7FEY37XY8Rq) - This helped me understand basic JS concepts. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
